Internet Store Application
This is an internet store application built with NestJS, a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. The application is built using a REST API architecture, and data is stored in MongoDB, which is accessed through the Prisma ORM. The application has been developed using a test-driven development (TDD) approach to ensure that all components are thoroughly tested.
